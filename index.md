I'm Manjin Kim, a Ph.D student in [Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/), South Korea. I am a member of the [computer vision lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH, under supervision of Professor [Minsu Cho](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mcho/). My research interest is in learning video representation and its applications.
